#### CuriosityCache

**A Personal Research Collection**

**About This Repository**  
Hi there! Welcome to CuriosityCache, my personal stash of research and notes on topics I’m exploring. I’m diving into AI, computer science, neuroscience, linguistics, and whatever else catches my interest. This isn’t a formal project—it’s more like a scrapbook of stuff I’ve learned, mostly for my own reference. I’m putting it out here because, well, why not? Maybe someone else will find it useful too, i'm using Obsidian so there might be inconsistencies in formatting here in github, which im too lazy to fix, you'll have to suffer, sorrie :).

Right now, you’ll find notes on things like reinforcement learning in large language models (e.g., DeepSeek R1), comparisons between human neurons and transformer networks, and some brain science basics (dendrites, axons, synapses). I’m also starting to poke into linguistics—think Chomsky. It’s a bit of a mixed bag, but that’s the point—it’s general, informal, and all about learning.

**Currently Includes**
- Infinite Lossless Compression Analysis
- Transformers and Reinforced learning
- Basic Neuronic Mechanisms Study

**What to Expect**  
This is a personal project, so it’s not super polished or structured. I threw it together in about a day of research, using some AI tools to help me along (gotta save time somehow!). I don’t have a strict update schedule—life’s busy, and I’m not always free (or motivated) to keep it current. I’ll add to it whenever I can or feel like it, so it’s pretty flexible. Don’t expect a finished product—this is more like a living document that grows when I do, tho im lazy sometimes to update stuff, but i do my research, so i might update the repo with tons of stuff at once, chill out and keep an eye :).

**Contributions**  
I’d love to see contributions if anyone’s interested! Feel free to fork this, add your own notes, fix stuff, or suggest ideas—especially if you’ve got insights on AI, linguistics, or anything I’ve touched on. No pressure, though—I’m not running a tight ship here. If you contribute, I’ll try to review and merge when I get the chance, but it might take a bit depending on my schedule. All I ask is keep it respectful and relevant to the “general knowledge” vibe.

**Goals (or Lack Thereof)**  
I don’t have grand plans for this—it’s not a startup or a formal study. It’s just me learning out loud and sharing the journey. I don’t expect anything specific to come of it, but I’m open to wherever it goes. If it helps someone, inspires a chat, or even just sits here quietly, that’s cool with me.

**License**  
This is licensed under the MIT License—feel free to use, share, or tweak it, just give a nod back to this repo if you do. Keeps it open and easy for everyone.

**Contact**  
No social media for me, but if you want to reach out, drop a comment or issue here on GitHub. I’ll see it eventually!

Thanks for stopping by—hope you find something interesting in this mess!
