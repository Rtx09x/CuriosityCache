Synaptic plasticity (how connections between neurons change).
[[Firing rates]] Matter

Here's a deeper dive, going beyond the simple "fire together, wire together" mantra:

**1. It's Not *Just* About Coincidence:**

*   **Timing is Everything (Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity - STDP):** [[Hebb's rule]], in its purest form, just says simultaneous firing is good. But *precise* timing matters a *lot*. STDP shows that if the pre-synaptic neuron fires *just before* the post-synaptic neuron (within a few milliseconds), the synapse gets *stronger* (LTP). But if the post-synaptic neuron fires *just before* the pre-synaptic neuron, the synapse often gets *weaker* [[Long-Term Depression (LTD)]]. This tiny timing difference is crucial for encoding information and refining neural circuits.
*   **Frequency Matters:** It's not just about single spikes. The *frequency* of firing also plays a role. High-frequency bursts of activity are more likely to induce LTP, while low-frequency stimulation can lead to LTD.
*   **Beyond Simple Correlation:** It's not enough for two neurons to be active at the same time; their activity needs to be meaningfully related. If two neurons are firing randomly, even if it's simultaneous, it's less likely to lead to strong strengthening. There needs to be some kind of causal or informational relationship.

**2. The Molecular Machinery is Complex:**

*   **Multiple Receptors:** There are many different types of receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, not just one. The most famous ones involved in LTP are NMDA receptors and AMPA receptors. NMDA receptors act like coincidence detectors â€“ they only open if the pre-synaptic neuron releases glutamate *and* the post-synaptic neuron is already depolarized.
*   **Calcium is King:** The influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) into the post-synaptic neuron through NMDA receptors is a critical trigger for both LTP and LTD. The *amount* and *timing* of calcium influx determine which way the synapse changes.
*   **Cascades of Signaling:** Calcium triggers a whole cascade of intracellular signaling pathways. These involve enzymes called kinases (which add phosphate groups to proteins) and phosphatases (which remove them). This complex dance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation ultimately leads to changes in the synapse.
*   **Protein Synthesis:** For long-lasting changes (like those lasting hours or days), new proteins need to be synthesized. This involves gene expression and the creation of new structural components for the synapse.

**3. Different Types of Plasticity:**

*   **Short-Term Plasticity:** Besides LTP and LTD, there are shorter-term forms of plasticity that last for seconds or minutes. These involve changes in the amount of neurotransmitter released or the sensitivity of receptors.
*   **Homeostatic Plasticity:** This is a mechanism that keeps the overall activity of a neuron within a reasonable range. If a neuron becomes too active, homeostatic mechanisms will weaken its synapses to bring it back down. If it's too inactive, synapses will be strengthened. It's like a thermostat for neuronal activity.
*   **Meta plasticity:** This is "plasticity of plasticity." The ability of a synapse to change can itself change depending on its past history of activity. It's like the rules of the game can change.

**4. It's Not Just About Synapses:**

*   **Intrinsic Plasticity:** Changes can also occur in the neuron's *intrinsic* properties, like its excitability (how easily it fires action potentials). This can involve changes in the number or type of ion channels in the neuron's membrane.
*   **Structural Plasticity:** The brain can physically rewire itself. This includes:
    *   **Synaptogenesis:** The formation of new synapses.
    *   **Synaptic Pruning:** The elimination of synapses that are not used.
    *   **Dendritic Spine Remodeling:** Dendritic spines (the tiny protrusions on dendrites where synapses form) can change their shape and size, affecting synaptic strength.
    *   **Neurogenesis:** In some brain regions, new neurons can even be born throughout life (though this is limited in humans).

**5. Global Factors Matter:**

*   **Neuromodulators:** Chemicals like dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine can have widespread effects on synaptic plasticity. They can enhance or inhibit LTP and LTD, depending on the situation. These neuromodulators often reflect things like attention, motivation, reward, and arousal.
*   **Sleep:** Sleep is crucial for consolidating memories and for synaptic plasticity. During sleep, some synapses are strengthened, while others are weakened, helping to refine neural circuits.
*   **Stress:** Chronic stress can impair synaptic plasticity and learning.

**So, in a, nutshell, while "neurons that fire together, wire together" is a good starting point, it's a vast oversimplification. The reality of synaptic plasticity is incredibly complex, involving precise timing, intricate molecular mechanisms, multiple forms of plasticity, and global factors that modulate the whole process. The brain is constantly rewiring itself based on experience, and the rules governing this rewiring are far more nuanced than Hebb's original rule suggests.**

I'd say this explanation is a bit more advanced and goes way deeper than the initial Hebb's rule explanation. Let me know if I missed anything or if you have questions.
