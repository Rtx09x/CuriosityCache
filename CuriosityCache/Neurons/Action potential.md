Basically, an action potential is a rapid change in the electrical charge across a neuron's membrane. It's how neurons communicate with each other, like sending a super-fast text message down a wire.

1. **Resting State:** Normally, a neuron sits at a "resting potential." This means there's a difference in charge between the inside and outside of the cell, kind of like a tiny battery. The inside is more negative (around -70 millivolts) compared to the outside. This is maintained by pumps and channels that move ions (charged particles) in and out.
    
2. **Stimulus:** Something happens to excite the neuron. This could be a signal from another neuron, a sensory input, whatever. This stimulus causes some ion channels to open.
    
3. **Depolarization:** If the stimulus is strong enough, it causes _sodium_ (Na+) channels to open. Sodium ions, which are positively charged, rush _into_ the neuron. This makes the inside of the neuron less negative, moving towards zero – this is called depolarization.
    
4. **Threshold:** If enough sodium enters and the neuron's voltage reaches a certain "threshold" (usually around -55 millivolts), it's like hitting the trigger. Boom! All the voltage-gated sodium channels swing wide open.
    
5. **Rising Phase:** Sodium floods in _super_ fast. The inside of the neuron quickly becomes _positive_, reversing the charge difference. This rapid spike is the "action" part of the action potential.
    
6. **Peak:** The action potential reaches its peak (around +30 to +40 millivolts).
    
7. **Repolarization:** At the peak, sodium channels start to close, and _potassium_ (K+) channels open. Potassium ions, also positively charged, rush _out_ of the neuron. This makes the inside of the neuron more negative again, moving back towards the resting potential. This is called repolarization.
    
8. **Hyperpolarization:** Sometimes, a few too many potassium ions leave, making the neuron even _more_ negative than its resting potential for a short time. This is called hyperpolarization, or the "refractory period." It's like a brief pause before the neuron can fire another action potential.
    
9. **Return to Resting Potential:** The sodium-potassium pump (a protein in the membrane) works to restore the original ion balance, kicking sodium out and pulling potassium back in. The neuron returns to its resting potential, ready to fire again.
    

**Key things to keep in mind:**

- **All-or-None:** Action potentials are "all-or-none." Either the neuron reaches the threshold and fires a full action potential, or it doesn't fire at all. There's no "half-assed" action potential.
- **One Direction:** Action potentials travel in one direction down the axon (the long, skinny part of the neuron) because the areas that just fired are in that refractory period.
- **Speed:** Action potentials are _fast_, allowing for rapid communication in the nervous system.
- It's like a wave of electrical activity.
