The presynaptic neuron is the neuron that's _sending_ the signal across a synapse to another neuron. It's the "talker" in the neuronal conversation.

Here's a breakdown:

- **"Pre" Means Before:** The prefix "pre" indicates that this neuron comes _before_ the synapse (the junction where communication happens).
- **Action Potential Arrival:** An electrical signal, called an action potential, travels down the axon (the long, slender projection) of the presynaptic neuron.
- **Neurotransmitter Release:** When the action potential reaches the axon terminal (the end of the axon), it triggers the release of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are stored in tiny sacs called vesicles.
- **Into the Synaptic Cleft:** The vesicles fuse with the presynaptic neuron's membrane, releasing the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (the small gap between neurons).
- **Sending the Message:** The neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron (the "listener" neuron), continuing the signal transmission.

In Simple words : The presynaptic neuron is the neuron initiating the communication by releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse. It's the origin point of the signal that gets passed on.
