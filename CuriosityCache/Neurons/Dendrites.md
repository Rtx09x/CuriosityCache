Dendrites are the branched extensions of a neuron that receive signals from other neurons. They are the primary *input* sites of a neuron, acting as the "antennae" that collect information from the vast network of neuronal connections within the nervous system. The term "dendrite" comes from the Greek word "dendron," meaning "tree," reflecting their often elaborate, tree-like branching patterns.

**Structure and Morphology**

Dendrites exhibit a remarkable diversity in their morphology, varying significantly between different neuron types and brain regions. This structural diversity is crucial for the specialized functions of different neurons. Key features include:

1.  **Dendritic Arbor:** The entire branching structure of a neuron's dendrites is called the dendritic arbor. The complexity of the arbor – the number of branches, their length, and their branching pattern – is a major determinant of the neuron's receptive field (the range of inputs it can receive).

2.  **Dendritic Shaft:** The main branches extending from the soma (cell body) are called dendritic shafts. These shafts typically taper (become thinner) as they extend further from the soma.

3.  **Dendritic Spines:** Many (but not all) dendrites are studded with small protrusions called dendritic spines. These are specialized structures that are the primary sites of excitatory synaptic input onto the neuron. Spines have a characteristic structure:
    *   **Spine Head:** The bulbous end of the spine, where the synapse is located.
    *   **Spine Neck:** A thin constriction connecting the spine head to the dendritic shaft. The neck can regulate the diffusion of molecules and ions between the spine head and the shaft, contributing to the compartmentalization of signals.
    * Different shapes, reflecting different states and synaptic strength, including:
        *   *Filopodia:* Long, thin protrusions, often seen during development.
        *   *Thin spines:* Long and thin, associated with weaker synapses.
        *   *Stubby spines:* Short and wide, often associated with stronger or more mature synapses.
        *   *Mushroom spines:* Large head and a thin neck, associated with strong, stable synapses.

4.  **Postsynaptic Density (PSD):** This is a specialized region within the spine head (and sometimes on the dendritic shaft) directly opposite the presynaptic terminal of the axon making contact. The PSD is a dense protein complex responsible for receiving and transducing the signal from the presynaptic neuron. Key components include:
    *   **Neurotransmitter Receptors:** These are proteins that bind to the neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron. Different types of receptors exist, each specific for certain neurotransmitters:
        *   *Ionotropic Receptors:* These are ligand-gated ion channels. When a neurotransmitter binds, the channel opens, allowing ions to flow across the membrane, directly changing the membrane potential. Examples include AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors (both for glutamate), and GABA-A receptors.
        *   *Metabotropic Receptors:* These are not ion channels themselves. Instead, they activate intracellular signaling cascades (via G proteins) that can indirectly modulate ion channels and have other effects on the cell. Examples include metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and GABA-B receptors.
    *   **Scaffolding Proteins:** These proteins organize the PSD and anchor receptors and signaling molecules in place. Examples include PSD-95, Shank, and Homer.
    *   **Signaling Molecules:** Enzymes (e.g., kinases, phosphatases) and other signaling molecules that are activated by neurotransmitter binding and mediate downstream effects, including changes in synaptic strength.
    * **Adhesion Molecules**: Proteins that help connect the pre- and postsynaptic membranes, stabilizing the synapse. Examples include neuroligins and neurexins.

5.  **Cytoskeleton:** The dendritic cytoskeleton is composed primarily of microtubules and actin filaments.
    *   **Microtubules:** Run longitudinally along the dendritic shaft, providing structural support and serving as tracks for the transport of organelles and proteins.
    *   **Actin Filaments:** Highly concentrated in dendritic spines, where they play a crucial role in spine structure, motility, and synaptic plasticity.

6.  **Organelles:** Dendrites contain various organelles, including:
    *   **Mitochondria:** Provide energy for synaptic function.
    *   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** Extends into dendrites and even into spines, playing roles in calcium regulation and protein synthesis.
    *   **Ribosomes:** Present in dendrites, allowing for local protein synthesis (translation of mRNA into proteins). This local protein synthesis is crucial for synaptic plasticity.

**Signal Integration**

Dendrites are not simply passive receivers of signals. They actively integrate the incoming synaptic inputs, and this integration is crucial for neuronal computation.

1.  **Postsynaptic Potentials (PSPs):** When a neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the dendrite, it causes a change in the membrane potential called a postsynaptic potential (PSP).
    *   **Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs):** Depolarize the membrane (make it more positive), increasing the likelihood that the neuron will fire an action potential. Typically caused by the influx of positive ions (e.g., Na+ through AMPA receptors).
    *   **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs):** Hyperpolarize the membrane (make it more negative), decreasing the likelihood of an action potential. Typically caused by the influx of negative ions (e.g., Cl- through GABA-A receptors) or the efflux of positive ions (e.g., K+).

2.  **Summation:** Dendrites receive inputs from many synapses (often thousands). These PSPs summate (add together) as they travel towards the axon hillock (the trigger zone for action potentials).
    *   **Spatial Summation:** PSPs from different synapses occurring at the same time sum together.
    *   **Temporal Summation:** PSPs from the same synapse occurring in rapid succession sum together.

3.  **Dendritic Integration:** The dendrite's structure and electrical properties influence how PSPs summate.
    *   **Passive Properties:** The cable properties of the dendrite (its diameter, membrane resistance, and internal resistance) affect how PSPs spread and decay as they travel.
    *   **Active Properties:** Some dendrites have voltage-gated ion channels (similar to those in axons) that can amplify or modify PSPs. This can allow for non-linear integration of inputs.

4.  **Action Potential Initiation:** If the summated PSPs at the axon hillock reach a threshold, an action potential is generated, and the neuron "fires."

**Dendritic Plasticity**

Dendrites, and particularly dendritic spines, are highly plastic structures. Their morphology and function can change in response to activity, contributing to learning and memory.

*   **Spine Plasticity:** Spine number, size, and shape can change, reflecting changes in synaptic strength. New spines can be formed, and existing spines can be eliminated.
*   **Synaptic Plasticity:** The strength of synaptic connections can be modified (long-term potentiation, LTP, or long-term depression, LTD). This involves changes in receptor number, receptor sensitivity, and the structure of the PSD.
* **Intrinsic Plasticity**: Changes in the excitability of the dendrite itself, often through modulation of voltage-gated ion channels.

Dendrites are the primary sites where neurons receive and integrate information, essential for the complex computations carried out by the brain. Their elaborate structure, dynamic properties, and capacity for plasticity make them key players in learning, memory, and all aspects of neuronal function.
