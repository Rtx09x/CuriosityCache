**Postsynaptic Membrane:**

- This is the _specific part_ of the postsynaptic neuron that's involved in receiving the signal. It's a specialized portion of the neuron's cell membrane.
- It's the area that contains the _receptors_. These receptors are like little docking stations for the neurotransmitters (the chemical messengers) released by the presynaptic neuron.
- The Postsynaptic membrane contains various ion channels which opens or closes based on the neurotransmitter released.

**Here is a simple way of understanding it:**

1. **Presynaptic Neuron** (the talker) releases neurotransmitters.
2. These neurotransmitters travel across the **synaptic cleft** (the gap).
3. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the **postsynaptic membrane** (the receiving part of the listener cell).
4. The **postsynaptic neuron** (the whole listening cell) gets the message and may fire its own signal.
