The core idea, often summarized as "**neurons that fire together, wire together**," explains how connections between neurons in the brain get stronger. Think of it like this: if two neurons are active at the same time, repeatedly, the link between them strengthens. It's like building a well-worn path between two places – the more you use that path, the easier it is to travel.

- [[Presynaptic neuron]] and [[Postsynaptic Neurons]]: Imagine two neurons: one sending a signal (the _pre-synaptic_ neuron) and one receiving it (the _post-synaptic_ neuron). They communicate across a tiny gap called a [[Synapses]].
    
- **Simultaneous Activation:** When the pre-synaptic neuron fires (sends an action potential) _and_, shortly after, the post-synaptic neuron _also_ fires, that's the key moment. This near-simultaneous activity is what matters.
    
- **Strengthening the Synapse:** This repeated, correlated firing triggers changes at the synapse. These changes can include:
    - Releasing _more_ neurotransmitter (the chemical messengers) from the pre-synaptic neuron.
    - Increasing the number of _receptors_ on the post-synaptic neuron (making it more sensitive to the neurotransmitter).
    - Even growing _new_ synaptic connections between the two neurons.
- [[Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)]]: The long-lasting strengthening of the synapse due to Hebbian learning is often called Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). It's a physical change in the brain that represents learning and memory at a cellular level.
    
- **It's not _just_ about firing at the exact same instant.** There's a bit of a time window. If the post-synaptic neuron fires shortly _after_ the pre-synaptic neuron, that's usually close enough to trigger strengthening. But if the post-synaptic neuron fires _way_ before or _way_ after, the connection might not strengthen, or it might even weaken (that's related to a different process called Long-Term Depression, or LTD).
    
- **"Use it or lose it":** The flip side of "fire together, wire together" is that if neurons _don't_ fire together, their connections tend to weaken over time. It's like a path that's not used becoming overgrown and eventually disappearing. This is crucial for brain plasticity – the brain's ability to reorganize itself based on experience.
    

**In essence, Hebb's rule provides a simple, yet powerful, explanation for how learning and memory work at a neural level.** It's not the whole story, of course – the brain is ridiculously complex – but it's a fundamental principle that helps us understand how experiences shape our brains. It shows how repeated experiences and associations can physically change the structure and function of our neural networks.
