The synaptic cleft is the tiny space between two neurons (nerve cells) where they communicate. Think of it like a narrow gap that a message has to jump across.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Neurons Don't Touch:** Neurons don't actually physically touch each other. There's always a small gap between the end of one neuron the [[Presynaptic neuron]] and the beginning of the next (the [[Postsynaptic neuron]]).
*   **Chemical Messengers:** When a signal (an action potential) reaches the end of the presynaptic neuron, it triggers the release of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.
*   **Crossing the Gap:** These neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft. They diffuse across this tiny space.
*   **Receiving the Message:** The neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. This binding is like a key fitting into a lock.
*   **Continuing the Signal:** When enough neurotransmitters bind to the receptors, it triggers a new signal in the postsynaptic neuron, and the message continues along its way.
* its width is almost 20-40nm.

So, in a nutshell, the synaptic cleft is the crucial gap where the chemical part of communication between neurons happens. It's where neurotransmitters are released, float across, and bind to receptors to pass the message along.
