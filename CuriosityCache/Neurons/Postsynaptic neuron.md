**Postsynaptic Neuron:**

- This is the _entire_ neuron that's _receiving_ the signal. Think of it as the "listener" in the conversation between neurons.
- It's the neuron _after_ the synapse (the junction where communication happens). So, "post" means "after."
the postsynaptic _neuron_ is the whole cell, and the postsynaptic _membrane_ is the specialized part of that cell's surface where the action happens.
